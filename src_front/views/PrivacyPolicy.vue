			<p><strong>In Short:</strong> If you choose to register or log in to our Services using a social media account, we may have access to certain information about you</p>

			<p>Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party social media account details (like your Twitch logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information about you from your social media provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your nickname, real name (with Youtube), your followers, and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to make public on such a social media platform.</p>

			<p>We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this privacy notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media provider.

			<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

			<p><strong>In Short:</strong> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</p>

			<p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.

			<p class="underline">Verification process</p>

			<p>Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide information so that we can match it with information you have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the information you provide with the information we already have on file, or we may contact you through a communication method (e.g. , phone or email) that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.</p>

			<p>We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.</p>

			<p class="underline">Other privacy rights</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You may object to the processing of your personal information.</li>
				<li>You may request correction of your personal data if it is incorrect or no longer relevant, or ask to restrict the processing of the information.</li>
