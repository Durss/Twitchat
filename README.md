<br>
A custom Twitch chat that aims to fill gaps in the official Twitch chat for streamers.
<br>
The main goal is to allow a streamer to follow his chat as best as possible.
<br>
<br>

For developers, **Twitchat exposes an API** to receive events and control some features remotely.\
Documentation can be found [here](PUBLIC_API.md).

# Project setup
First, create a `credentials.json` file on the root directory and fill in these values:
```json
{
	"client_id": "",
	"client_secret": "",
	"redirect_uri": "http://localhost:8080/oauth",
	"csrf_key": "",
	"scopes": [
		"chat:read",
		"chat:edit",
		"channel:read:redemptions",
		"channel:moderate",
		"moderation:read",
		"moderator:manage:automod",
		"channel:manage:polls",
		"channel:manage:predictions",
		"channel:read:hype_train",
		"channel_editor",
		"whispers:edit",
		"user:read:follows",
		"channel:edit:commercial",
		"channel:read:subscriptions"
	]
}
```
Create a [Twitch application](https://dev.twitch.tv/console) and fill in the `client_id` and `client_secret` values.\
Write anything in the `csrf_key` field, it will be used to secure twitch authentication from CSRF attacks.\
Configure the redirect URI of the Twitch application with your localhost and/or production URI.\
Set it as the `redirect_uri` value of the credentials.\
The `redirect uri` must end with `/oauth`, example:
```
http://localhost:8080/oauth
```
<br>
By default the server listens on port 3018, you can change it on `server.js` and `src/utils/Config.ts`.

# Compile project
### Install dependencies
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run dev
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Run server
```
node server.js
```
<br>
<br>
<br>

# Install server
[Compile the project](#compile-project) and push the `server.js` file on your server.\
Next to this file, create a `dist` folder and push the content of your local `dist` folder inside it.\
Also add the `credentials.json` and `fakeEvents.json` files at the root of the project.\
Create an `env.conf` file, just write `prod` inside, and push it at the root of the project.\
Install all the production dependencies and [run the server](#run-server).
\
Here is the expected file structure:\
─ root\
  ├─ dist/\
  ├─ node_modules/\
  ├─ server.js\
  ├─ env.conf\
  ├─ credentials.json\
  ├─ fakeEvents.json\
<br>
<br>
<br>

# Server
The server is super basic for now as there aren’t much needs.
For this reason, it’s a just a single file server coded in vanilla JS that doesn’t need any compilation. That might change in the future.
