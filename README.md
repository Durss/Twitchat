```
Create a [twitch application](https://dev.twitch.tv/console) and fill in the `client_id` and `client_secret` values.\
Write anything you want in the `csrf_key` field, it will be used to secure twitch authentication from CSRF attacks.\
Configure the redirect URI of the twitch application to:\
```
http://localhost:8081/oauth
```
*(adapt with the proper port and domain if deploying online)*\
Set the same value to the `redirect_uri` property of the `credentials.json` file.\

You can also create a [spotify application](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard) and fill in the spotify `spotify_client_id` and `spotify_client_secret`
<br>
By default the server listens on port 3018, you can change it on `credentials.json` and `src_front/utils/Config.ts`.

# Environment setup
This project has been coded with VSCode.\
It is recommended to install these plugins:\
Vue Plugin: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar

I18n-ally Plugin: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lokalise.i18n-ally

<br>
<br>
<br>

# Compile project
### Install dependencies
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run dev
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Run server
```
node server/boostrap.js
```
<br>
<br>
<br>

# Install server
All the following MUST be done on a seperate folder from the GIT project.\
[Compile the project](#compile-project) and push the content of the `server` folder on your server root.\
Next to this file, create a `public` folder and push the content of your local `dist` folder inside it.\
Also add the `credentials` folder inside a `data` older at the root of the project.\
Create an `env.conf` file, just write `prod` inside, and push it at the root of the project.\
Install all the production dependencies and [run the server](#run-server).
\
Here is the expected file structure:\
â”€ root\
Â Â â”œâ”€ node_modules/\
Â Â â”œâ”€ public/\
Â Â â”œâ”€ utils/\
Â Â â”œâ”€ data/\
Â Â Â Â â”œâ”€ credentials/\
Â Â â”œâ”€ controllers/\
Â Â â”œâ”€ bootstrap.js\
Â Â â”œâ”€ env.conf\
<br>
<br>
<br>

# Localization
# Adding new language
Just create a new folder under the `i18n` folder with the ISO 639-1 code of the language.\
Read the next section to know how to translate labels

# Translating labels
To make localization as easy as possible, a dedicated interface has been made that lists all available categories and labels with the possibility to edit them.\
Any update on this interface triggers a rebuild of the compiled file as well as an update on any twitchat page opened on the same browser.\
\
The interface is only accessible to adminitrators and can be found here:\
[localhost:8081/labels](https://localhost:8081/labels)\
To get admin rights you must set your twitch user ID under the `admin_ids` array in the `credentials.json` file.\

# Adding new labels
If you need to add new labels, you'll have to edit JSON sources.\
All label files can be found under `i18n` folder.\
They are splitted by language then by sections.\
Any new file or folder structure can be added to this.\
These are all merged into `static/labels.json` during the build process.\
\
Files can have any name but all labels within it must be under a single property that will be the base path to use the label. The property name is usually the same as the file's name.\
Example:
```
â”€ en\
Â Â â”œâ”€ global.json\
Â Â â”œâ”€ home.json/\
Â Â â”œâ”€ triggers.json/\
```
`global.json` example:
```json
{
	"global":{
		"hello":"World"
	}
}
```
`home.json` example:
```json
{
	"home":{
		"lorem":"ipsum dolor sit amet"
	}
}
```
This will output this JSON file:
```json
{
	"en":{
		"global":{
			"hello":"World"
		},
		"hello":{
			"lorem":"ipsum dolor sit amet"
		}
	}
}
```
<br>
<br>
<br>

# Package Stream Deckâ„¢ plugin
Run the following command:
```
npm run streamdeck_package
```
The compiled plugin will be there `streamdeck_plugin/fr.twitchat.streamDeckPlugin`.
