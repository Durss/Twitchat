elle est très basique et ne permet pas un filtrage complexe.","Si vous bloquez le mot <mark>twitchat</mark>, les viewers peuvent facilement contourner cette restriction en écrivant <mark>twit_chat</mark> ou <mark>twitch🅐t</mark> et une infinité d'alternatives.","","Des bots comme <a href=\"https://nightbot.tv\" target=\"_blank\">Nightbot</a> ou <a href=\"https://wizebot.tv/index\" target=\"_blank\">Wizebot</a> permettent de filtrer les messages avec des règles plus complexes via ce que l'on appelle des <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression\" target=\"_blank\">Expressions régulières</a>.","","La fonction automod de <strong>Twitchat</strong> vous permet également d'utiliser des expressions régulières, mais tente également de rendre l'utilisation de caractères alternatifs inefficace pour contourner les règles de filtrage.","Avant d'appliquer une règle, Twitchat remplacera tous les caractères alternatifs, y compris les caractères accentués, par leur équivalent latin.","Par exemple, <mark>𝕥🅦ⓘ𝒕𝓬🄷🇦🇹</mark> sera remplacé par <mark>twitchat</mark> avant de lui appliquer les règles de filtrage.","","<strong>Attention</strong> cependant, ce processus a un coût sur les performances et peut ralentir un peu Twitchat si vous avez beaucoup de règles et que vous recevez beaucoup de messages."]},"delete":{"title":"La suppression d'un message est-elle efficace contre le doxxing* ?","contents":["Non.","","Mais c'est le seul moyen de modérer un message après son envoi.","Le principal problème est que des extensions comme <a href=\"https://betterttv.com\" target=\"_blank\">BetterTTV</a> permettent aux viewers de conserver les messages supprimés.","","<strong>Si vous voulez éviter cela</strong>, vous devrez configurer un délai de chat <i>(<a href=\"https://dashboard.twitch.tv/settings/moderation\" target=\"_blank\">voir options de chat</a>)</i>. Si un message est supprimé pendant ce laps de temps, il ne sera affiché nulle part, même pour les personnes utilisant BTTV.","<i>Notez que le message est tout de même envoyé à tout le monde, il reste donc techniquement possible de le consulter. Mais cela demande des connaissances en développement.</i>","","Le seul moyen sûr de filtrer un message est de faire en sorte que Twitch le supprime avant de l'envoyer à tout le monde.
