But by the end of June 2023, the verdict was clear: the chemotherapy was no longer effective, and cancer had won.","It was estimated that he had only a few months left to live, at most a year.","But this news took a toll on his mental health; depression joined the battle with cancer, and just one month later, everything escalated.","In early August, he lost all his cognitive abilities, his speech, his ability to eat and move, he no longer recognized his wife, was lost in the house he lived in for +30 years, ...","I was terrified by the thought of missing the opportunity to say goodbye and tell him I loved him before he ceased to be himself and disappeared.","He was hospitalized for a week, and by some miracle, he regained all his mental faculties and motor skills.","But this joy was short-lived.","On September 4th, his body couldn't hold on any longer, and he was hospitalized once again.","On September 7th, he sought the approval of the doctor who had been following him for all these years and the rest of the family to end his life before the cancers caused too much suffering and permanently affected his cognitive abilities. Aware that he was in the terminal phase, he no longer had any purpose that gave him the will to fight.","As difficult as it was, this decision made him smile again. He was laughing again, cracking jokes and punchlines as he used to.","He remained joyful until the very end.","On September 10th at 12 o'clock, he was placed in deep sedation, waiting for his body to collapse... he fell asleep hearing us, overcome by a fit of laughter mixed with tears of joy and devastation.","Perhaps this laughter also lightened the situation for the nurse who found it very difficult to accompany a conscious, sharp-minded man towards death, someone who was always kind to the medical staff.","On September 14th he dies.","18 years.","18 years during which our mother accompanied him, supported him, and did absolutely everything sho could for him.","If my father was a warrior, my mother is an immense warrior to whom we owe so much for having had 18 more years with our father."," ","Goodbye, my dear Pap's... 💖"]}},"account":{"connected_as":"Connected as {USER}","donation_public":"Makes your login visible by everyone on the donor list under {LINK}","about_link":"@:params.categories.donate section","installBt":"Install Twitchat","updatesBt":"Latest updates","erase_dataBt":"Erase local parameters","erase_confirm_title":"Erase local parameters?","erase_confirm_description":"This will only erase parameters from this browser.<br>Triggers, voice commands, text to speech actions, automod params, emergency params, etc... will be reset.","authorization":"Authorizations","language":"Interface language","share":{"info":"If you want to share your parameters between multiple accounts, click the \"Connect\" button below and authenticate with your secondary account.\n\nThe data from the second account will be replaced by the ones of your current \"{USER}\" account.","connectBt":"Connect","sharingList":"Currently sharing with","unlinkBt":"Unlink","unlink_fail":"Something unknown went wrong when unlinking requested user :(","unlink_confirm":{"title":"Unlink","description":"This user won't share your data anymore.

avec lui et en conserver une trace.","Mais la maladie en a décidé autrement, l'emportant plus rapidement qu'espéré.","À défaut d'avoir ici une trace créée par lui, je lui rends ce petit hommage."," ","Mon père était un guerrier car il s'est battu durant 18 ans contre les cancers, +130 chimiothérapies au compteur. Mais fin juin 2023 le verdict était sans appel, les chimios ne faisaient plus effet, les cancers avaient gagné.","Il était estimé qu'il lui restait quelques mois à vivre, 1 an tout au plus.","Mais cette nouvelle avait attaqué son mental, la dépression rejoignait le cancer, et seulement 1 mois plus tard tout s'emballait.","Début août il perdait toutes ses capacités cognitives, perdait la parole, ne savait plus se nourir ni se déplacer, ne reconnaissait pas sa femme, se perdait dans la maison qu'il habitait de puis +30 ans, ...","J'étais terrifié à l'idée d'avoir raté l'occasion de lui dire adieu et que je l'aimais avant qu'il ne soit plus lui-même et disparaisse.","Il a alors été hospitalisé 1 semaine et par miracle a retrouvé tous ses esprits et capacités motrices.","Mais cette joie n'était que temporaire","Le 4 septembre son corps ne tient plus, il est à nouveau hospitalisé.","Le 7 septembre il demande l'accord au médecin qui le suivait depuis toutes ces années ainsi qu'au reste de la famille de mettre fin à ses jours pour partir avant que les cancers ne le fassent trop souffrir et attaquent définitivement ses capacités cognitives. Ayant conscience qu'il était en phase terminale, il n'avait plus aucun but lui donnant envie de se battre.","Aussi dure soit-elle, cette décision courageuse lui avait fait retrouver le sourir. Il riait à nouveau, enchaînait les blagues et punchlines comme avant.","Jusqu'au bout il sera joyeux.","Le 10 septembre à 12h, il est placé en sédation profonde dans l'attente que son corps lâche... il s'endormira nous entendant pris d'un fou-rire mêlant larmes de rire et de dévastation.","Ce fou-rire a peut-être aussi eu le mérite d'alléger la situation pour l'infirmière qui vivait très mal d'accompagner vers la mort un homme conscient, vif d'esprit et toujours adorable avec le personnel médical.","Le 14 septembre au matin il s'éteint.","18 ans.","18 ans durants lesquels notre mère l'a accompagné, soutenu, et a absolument tout fait pour lui.","Si mon père était un guerrier, ma mère est une immense guerrière à qui on doit énormément d'avoir eu 18 ans de plus avec notre

les viewers peuvent facilement contourner cette restriction en écrivant <mark>twit_chat</mark> ou <mark>twitch🅐t</mark> et une infinité d'alternatives.","","Des bots comme <a href=\"https://nightbot.tv\" target=\"_blank\">Nightbot</a> ou <a href=\"https://wizebot.tv/index\" target=\"_blank\">Wizebot</a> permettent de filtrer les messages avec des règles plus complexes via ce que l'on appelle des <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression\" target=\"_blank\">Expressions régulières</a>.","","La fonction automod de <strong>Twitchat</strong> vous permet également d'utiliser des expressions régulières, mais tente également de rendre l'utilisation de caractères alternatifs inefficace pour contourner les règles de filtrage.","Avant d'appliquer une règle, Twitchat remplacera tous les caractères alternatifs, y compris les caractères accentués, par leur équivalent latin.","Par exemple, <mark>𝕥🅦ⓘ𝒕𝓬🄷🇦🇹</mark> sera remplacé par <mark>twitchat</mark> avant de lui appliquer les règles de filtrage.","","<strong>Attention</strong> cependant, ce processus a un coût sur les performances et peut ralentir un peu Twitchat si vous avez beaucoup de règles et que vous recevez beaucoup de messages."]},"delete":{"title":"La suppression d'un message est-elle efficace contre le doxxing* ?","contents":["Non.","","Mais c'est le seul moyen de modérer un message après son envoi.","Le principal problème est que des extensions comme <a href=\"https://betterttv.com\" target=\"_blank\">BetterTTV</a> permettent aux viewers de conserver les messages supprimés.","","<strong>Si vous voulez éviter cela</strong>, vous devrez configurer un délai de chat <i>(<a href=\"https://dashboard.twitch.tv/settings/moderation\" target=\"_blank\">voir options de chat</a>)</i>. Si un message est supprimé pendant ce laps de temps, il ne sera affiché nulle part, même pour les personnes utilisant BTTV.","<i>Notez que le message est tout de même envoyé à tout le monde, il reste donc techniquement possible de le consulter. Mais cela demande des connaissances en développement.</i>","","Le seul moyen sûr de filtrer un message est de faire en sorte que Twitch le supprime avant de l'envoyer à tout le monde.
