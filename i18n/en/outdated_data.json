Depending on your chat activity and the options you have enabled, you might reach these limits, which could cause problems.\n\nFinally, it is impossible for Twitchat to function properly beyond 3 simultaneous instances. This corresponds to the maximum simultaneous connections to a specific Twitch service. Beyond that, Twitch will cut one or the other of the connections.",
